# Cistern Fleet Management Improvements

## Current Milestone: Fleet Management Automation & Scaling Improvements

### Analysis Summary
After analyzing the current Cistern fleet management system, I've identified the following:

**Current State:**
- Basic inventory management exists with YAML-based inventory file
- Manual fleet deployment using deploy-rs
- Limited automation for multi-server management
- No automatic service distribution or load balancing
- No fleet-wide health monitoring or rollback capabilities
- Manual process for adding new servers to the fleet

**Key Areas for Improvement:**
1. Automated fleet discovery and registration
2. Service distribution and failover capabilities
3. Fleet-wide configuration synchronization
4. Centralized monitoring and alerting
5. Automated scaling based on load/availability
6. Role-based server management

### Sprint 1: Enhanced Inventory Management
- [ ] Add server health status tracking to inventory.yaml
- [ ] Create inventory validation with server connectivity checks
- [ ] Add automatic inventory updates from deployed servers
- [ ] Implement server tagging and grouping capabilities

- [ ] Implement automatic hardware profile selection

### Sprint 3: Service Distribution & Load Balancing
- [ ] Create service placement strategy module
- [ ] Implement primary/replica service distribution
- [ ] Add automatic failover capabilities
