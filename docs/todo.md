# Cistern Fleet Management Improvements

## Current Milestone: Fleet Management Automation & Scaling Improvements

### Analysis Summary
After analyzing the current Cistern fleet management system, I've identified the following:

**Current State:**
- Basic inventory management exists with YAML-based inventory file
- Manual fleet deployment using deploy-rs
- Limited automation for multi-server management
- No automatic service distribution or load balancing
- No fleet-wide health monitoring or rollback capabilities
- Manual process for adding new servers to the fleet

**Key Areas for Improvement:**
1. Automated fleet discovery and registration
2. Service distribution and failover capabilities
3. Fleet-wide configuration synchronization
4. Centralized monitoring and alerting
5. Automated scaling based on load/availability
6. Role-based server management

### Sprint 1: Enhanced Inventory Management
- [ ] Add server health status tracking to inventory.yaml
- [ ] Create inventory validation with server connectivity checks
- [ ] Add automatic inventory updates from deployed servers
- [ ] Implement server tagging and grouping capabilities
- [ ] Add fleet-wide configuration templates

### Sprint 2: Automated Fleet Discovery & Registration
- [ ] Create automatic server discovery via mDNS/Avahi
- [ ] Implement self-registration endpoint for new servers
- [ ] Add SSH key distribution automation
- [ ] Create server capability detection (CPU, RAM, storage)
- [ ] Implement automatic hardware profile selection

### Sprint 3: Service Distribution & Load Balancing
- [ ] Create service placement strategy module
- [ ] Implement primary/replica service distribution
- [ ] Add automatic failover capabilities
- [ ] Create shared storage coordination for services
- [ ] Implement service health checks and auto-restart

### Sprint 4: Fleet-Wide Monitoring & Management
- [ ] Create centralized Prometheus configuration
- [ ] Implement fleet-wide dashboard with Grafana
- [ ] Add automated alerting for service failures
- [ ] Create fleet status CLI command
- [ ] Implement rolling deployment capabilities

### Sprint 5: Advanced Automation Features
- [ ] Create auto-scaling based on resource usage
- [ ] Implement automatic backup distribution
- [ ] Add fleet-wide configuration sync
- [ ] Create disaster recovery automation
- [ ] Implement zero-downtime updates

## Completed Milestones

### Secrets Management Security Enhancement (Completed)

**Summary:**
Successfully implemented comprehensive secrets management using agenix for NixOS, replacing all plain text secret storage with encrypted alternatives. The system now provides encryption at rest for all secrets while maintaining backwards compatibility during migration.

**Key Achievements:**
- Integrated agenix for encrypted secret storage with age encryption
- Created modular secrets management system with migration support
- Implemented automatic API key generation and encryption
- Added secure password management for authentication
- Built comprehensive migration tools and documentation
- Implemented security hardening with monitoring and auditing
- Created automatic cleanup for plain text secrets post-migration

**Security Improvements:**
- All secrets now encrypted at rest using age
- Automatic security warnings for plain text secrets
- Access logging and monitoring with inotify
- Daily security audits with compliance checks
- Secure cleanup process with backups
- Option to disable plain text fallback entirely

**Documentation Created:**
- Complete secrets management guide
- Migration procedures and scripts
- Security best practices documentation
- Troubleshooting guide

This milestone significantly enhances the security posture of Cistern deployments by ensuring all sensitive data is properly encrypted and managed.
